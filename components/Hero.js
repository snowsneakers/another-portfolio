                         üëãüèæ {"I'm"} Pat, a software
                         engineer. I have always had two loves, computing and
                         the human body. I studied exercise science and became
                         fascinated with biomechanics. Throughout undergrad and
                         after graduation, I worked as a basketball coach. I
                         used basketball to not only improve my leadership and
                         communication skills but also to explore biomechanics.
                         I focused primarily on teaching athletes optimal form.
                         Unfortunately, the pandemic shut down most sports
                         leagues. During that time, I decided to switch gears
                         and explore that other passion, computing. I can now
                         combine these two passions and bring a lot to a team.
                         Not only in terms of the technology but also with my
                         experience in biomechanics and working with athletes.{" "}
